Hello! My name is Salman Alfarisi, but you can call me Salman. I'm a web developer  who focused on crafting efficient, modern, and useful web applications. My experience in web development has equipped me with the skills to build dynamic, user-friendly websites, and I stay updated on the latest tech trends in this rapidly evolving field. I have interest in web development, particularly in designing backend architectures, handling database operations, creating APIs, and ensuring data security.

From my education history, I graduated in Physics with major in Electronics and Instrumentation (Minor Computer Science) from Diponegoro University. Furthermore, from my major, I have learned and understanding of programming algorithms, computer devices, and software development. I have developed web application with JavaScript, Laravel, Database Management System such as MySQL, and collaborate with GIT. I also have abilities to maintain computer devices including software and hardware and make sure the device works properly.

Iâ€™m also developing my personal website with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The design is inspired by <a href='https://nevflynn.com' target='_blank'>nevflynn.com</a>. For a closer look at my work, you can explore my GitHub repository <a href='https://github.com/mansalmann/portfolio' target='_blank'>here</a>.
